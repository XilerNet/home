    <h4> Donâ€™t take our word for it, try it out! </h4>
    <p>While many projects make promises they can't keep, we've taken a different approach. We've already built our
        tools before releasing them, so go ahead and give them a try!</p>

        <h5>Try our dns node!</h5>
        <p>
            We have a supervised public DNS node available for hosting. Feel free to utilize it or host your own!
            Try it at: <span>127.0.0.1</span>
        </p>

    <!-- This section should be hidden in the release -->
    <section>
        <h5>Try our reverse proxy!</h5>
        <p>To enable universal access without requiring DNS settings changes, we've developed a proxy that acts as the
            website. Please note that we assume no responsibility for the displayed content.</p>
